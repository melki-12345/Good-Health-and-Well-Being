                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            The webtemplete.html file serves as an HTML5 document that supports Good Health and 
                            Well-Being (SDG 3) through its website design. The document begins with (!DOCTYPE html) and 
                            contains (html lang="en") to specify English language. Webtemplate serves as the title while meta 
                            tags handle encoding and responsiveness and both global3.css and home_page.css receive links in the 
                            head section. The body section contains a header with logo and title and navigation links to Home, 
                            Volunteer and Feedback pages which activate hover effects. A placeholder comment indicates the section 
                            for main content insertion. The footer contains three parts which include website name and description 
                            followed by quick links and page editors before concluding with a copyright notice that recognizes the development team.</p>
                        <br>
                    <h4>Global Stylesheet(Global.css)</h4>
                        <p>
                            The global3.css file contains website-wide styles that use CSS variables (e.g., --primary: #61bb77;) for color consistency 
                            and includes a CSS reset for standardized styling. The body section of the website displays sans-serif text on a light background 
                            through global styles while the header section utilizes flexbox to position elements and adds hover effects to navigation links. The 
                            footer contains three sections (name/description, links, and editors) which use flexbox for responsive design and hover effects. The site 
                            utilizes media queries to adjust to various screen sizes and the .btn class creates button styles which perform hover animations.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p><h4>1. Semantic HTML Structure:</h4> The HTML code contains meaningful elements including (h1, p, ul, and nav) to create structured documents that assist screen readers. The (header) as well as (footer) along with (nav) tags increase accessibility through their role in defining distinct assistive technology landmarks.</p>
                        <p><h4>2. Alt Text for Images:</h4> The header logo contains an alt attribute (alt="sdg3logo") that provides text description for screen reader users. A blank alt attribute (alt="") should be applied to decorative logos to prevent screen readers from making unnecessary announcements.</p>
                        <p><h4>3. Keyboard Navigation:</h4> Users with motor disabilities can benefit from the hover effect (nav a:hover) that provides visual feedback while the navigation links in the header become accessible through sequential navigation using the Tab key. The template requires a "Page Editor" button to perform keyboard accessibility tests because this element is currently absent.</p>
                        <p><h4>4. Auto-Redirection Considerations:</h4> The template avoids using the meta http-equiv="refresh" element for auto-redirection because this practice helps prevent disruptions for users who depend on assistive technologies. The redirection process should use visible alerts or buttons as manual methods to notify users before moving them to a different page.</p>
                        <p><h4>5. CSS Variables:</h4> CSS variables that I defined as --primary and other similar terms enable quick maintenance and repeated application of color schemes within the website.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>
                            The home.html file functions as the primary entry point for a website dedicated to Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3). The header 
                            contains a logo and title alongside a navigation bar that links to Home, Volunteer and Feedback pages with visual feedback during 
                            hovering. The SDG 3 Description Section explains SDG 3 fundamentals while the Mission Section presents the initiative's objectives. The Main 
                            Content Section displays four feature cards about Health Awareness, Mental Well-Being, Physical Fitness and Nutrition & Diet which contain images 
                            and descriptions and "Read More" buttons. The footer contains three parts which include website identification and description followed by quick 
                            links and page editor sections before ending with copyright information. The page delivers an accessible design with responsive features and easy usability.</p> 
                        <br>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p><h4>1. Semantic HTML Structure:</h4> The page enhances document structure through meaningful elements including (h1, h2, p, section) and (nav) which also supports screen reader compatibility.</p>
                        <p><h4>2. Alt Text for Images:</h4> All images on the page including the logo and feature card images contain alt attributes which provide text descriptions for screen readers (alt="sdg3logo", alt="Health Awareness", etc.).</p>
                        <p><h4>3. Keyboard Navigation:</h4> The navigation links together with "Read More" buttons can be accessed using the Tab key so users can move through interactive elements one after another.</p>

The table contains the following structure: The header row presents both a logo and two main columns named "Average Percentage (Per Year)" and "Prevention". The sub-header contains statistical icons and prevention symbols. The data table presents diseases (Mental Disorders, Diabetes, Cancer, Obesity) with their occurrence rates and prevention strategies through unordered lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) which contain hyperlinks (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) for further information.<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The sidebar menu (<code>&lt;ul id="sideBar"&gt;</code>) located below the header enables users to access different content sections through internal page links (#section1, #section2, etc.) which lead to Introduction, Challenges, Tips and Benefits. A scrollable <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> contains the main content which organizes its information across four structured sections. The challenges section organizes widespread mental health problems into separate <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> subheadings that explain anxiety, stress, depression, burnout and social isolation. The tips section uses an unordered list to present practical mental well-being improvement methods which include hobbies and mindfulness practice and proper sleep scheduling. Good mental health benefits include emotional stability with added productivity along with stronger relationships according to the bullet-pointed list in this section. The page uses images (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) to visually enhance content while displaying mental health-related illustrations throughout its length. The page displays images related to mental well-being through a structured table format with three columns. Text alignment together with spacing and image formatting occurs through inline CSS styles but the website maintains consistent design through external stylesheets.</p> 
                            <br>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p><h4>1. Friendly Navigation:</h4> Users can navigate through the page using the sidebar menu (<code>&lt;ul id="sideBar"&gt;</code>) which contains anchor links (<code>&lt;a href="#sectionX"&gt;</code>). The navigation bar (<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>) contains links to various pages which are organized into a tabbed format for simple navigation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><h4>2. Responsive Design:</h4> The website utilizes <code>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</code> element to achieve proper dimensions when users switch between different screen sizes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><h4>3. Well-Formatted Lists for Readability:</h4> The page displays tips and benefits through <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> lists which create an organized and easy-to-read format.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <br>
                    <p>Challenges:</p>
                    <p> 
                        1.The core challenge involve providing clear content comprehension paths that meet at least the 
                        requirements for users with disabilities. Interface designers must create systems which anyone can 
                        understand and use without limitations based on their abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.The combination of global3.css and content_page.css stylesheet files proved difficult to merge because 
                        it resulted in inconsistent visual design elements.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lessons Learned:</p> 
                    <p>
                        1.The implementation of keyboard navigation has proven to boost site accessibility because it enables 
                        users with motor disabilities to move through the site with ease. Users with visual impairments benefit 
                        from appropriate color contrast selection because it enhances their ability to read and understand the content.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        2.The implementation of a unified CSS file containing deployable design rules for button, header and card elements allows 
                        the website to maintain consistent appearance. The combined stylesheet structure leads to an integrated design which eliminates 
                        repetitive stylistic features.</p>

                    <p>
                        Explain how developed pages follow the Janet regulations which control web page publication standards. Demonstration of understanding and 
                        implementation of these regulations needs to be included. Be realistic and truthful.<br><br>The semantic elements include h1, h2, footer and nav 
                        tags which fulfill Janet regulations through improved structure and screen reader accessibility. The structured page organization helps users 
                        with disabilities and all other users easily access the content through simple navigation.
