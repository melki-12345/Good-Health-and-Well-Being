                        <p><h4>3. Keyboard Navigation:</h4> The layout and interactive elements are designed to be fully navigable using keyboard controls, with proper focus management for links and form elements. Also uses aria-label for better screen reader descriptions.</p>

                <h2 id="ContentVal">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The HTML page uses semantic elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to create a logical structure for health awareness content. The CSS employs fixed positioning for the sidebar navigation, ensuring consistent access to content sections. 
                            The main content area uses overflow scrolling to handle extensive text. The image gallery utilizes CSS floats and borders for responsive layout, while tables employ <code>&lt;border-collapse&gt;</code> for readability. Key CSS properties include <code>&lt;margiin&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pading&gt;</code>, 
                            and hover effects to enhance usability and visual feedback. The design balances fixed elements for navigation with fluid content areas, creating a user-friendly experience that presents complex nutritional information in an accessible format.</p> 
                            <br>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p><h4>1. Meaningful navigation:</h4> The navigation menu employs descriptive link text and an unordered list format, which is accessible to assistive technologies. This also makes the navigation menu easier to navigate for users and to switch into sepcific topics fastwhile reading.</p>
                        <p><h4>2. Better image alignment:</h4> The images are well used and the positions are well fixed using image alignment. The images are under a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element where there is a class used for the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element <code>&lt;div class=imgs&gt;</code>which consists of image alignment except individual image alignment as well.</p>

                    <p>1. It was diificult to decorate images and it was even more difficult to fix the size of them.</p> 
                    <p>2. When creating the glow over hover effect in the Team Page, it was diificult to make it look more brighter as I had to use several box-shadow statements to get it right.</p>
                    <p>3. It was also difficult to make the background image in Team Page and Feedback Page look less brighter and it was even more difficult to fix the size of them while making it not repeat when the user scrolls. </p>
                    <p>4. It was comparatively difficult to make the images have an alternate image if the main image is gone or missing.</p>
                    <p>5. I learnt that giving an alternative text and an alternative image for an image is very important and also a better practice.</p>
